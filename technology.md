# Technologies Used

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Jupyter Notebook/Pandas and Matplotlib will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Using to Further analysis will be completed using NumPy Python. 

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.

## Machine Learning
Python's scikit-learn will be employed to create a supervised machine learning binary classification model using the stroke patient data csv file. The goal is to create a model that is able to determine whether or not a patient is at a high risk of having a stroke based on various characteristics of the patient.

## Dashboard
The dashboard will be hosted on Tableau Public software, for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
